# SourceMonitor

Jim Wanner retired from software development. The software SourceMonitor will become open source. There are several things from preventing the code completely accessible for everyone e. g. licensed code, generated code of abandoned tools and other challenges.

## About SourceMonitor

The programm is able to collect metrics from source code:

- Collects metrics in a fast, single pass through source files.
- Measures metrics for source code written in C++, C, C#, VB.NET, Java, Delphi, Visual Basic (VB6) or HTML.
- Includes method and function level metrics for C++, C, C#, VB.NET, Java, and Delphi.
- Offers Modified Complexity metric option.
- Saves metrics in checkpoints for comparison during software development projects.
- Displays and prints metrics in tables and charts, including Kiviat diagrams.
- Operates within a standard Windows GUI or inside your scripts using XML command files.
- Exports metrics to XML or CSV (comma-separated-value) files for further processing with other tools.

## Motivation

In my life as a software developer I have come to appreciate and love SourceMonitor. After doing an update, I read that Jim will no longer be actively developing SourceMonitor. When I suggested him to make SourceMonitor OpenSource, we got more in contact. I would like to make this great project OpenSource and develop it further.

## Develop0ment

We started with re-development in [this][sourcemonitoros] repository.
