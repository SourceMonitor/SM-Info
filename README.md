# SourceMonitor Information

The developer of [SourceMonitor], Jim Wanner, retires from software development. The software will become open source and a new home at GitHub.

There is support needed:

- C/C++ developers
- Replacement of licensed code with open source code
- Know how for git pages
- Know how for GitHub automation

Some ideas for future development:

- Replace legacy parser with an [ANTLR4][ANTLR] parser
- Platform independent UI
- Plugins for each language
