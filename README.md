# SourceMonitor Information

The developoer of [SourceMonitor], Jim Wanner, retires from software development. The software will become open source and a new home at GitHub.

There is support needed:

- C/C++ developers
- Replacement of licensed code with open source code
- KnowHow for git pages
- KnowHow for GitHub automation

Some ideas for future development:

- Replace legacy parser with an [ANTLR4][ANTLR] parser
- Use platform independent UI
- Use plugin mechanism for each language
